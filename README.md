Project Description

The Online Bookstore App is designed to provide users with a seamless and interactive platform for browsing and purchasing books. The goal of this project is to develop a fully functional bookstore application where users can easily sign up for a new account, log in, and explore a curated list of the top 10 popular books.

In addition to browsing, the app includes essential e-commerce functionalities such as adding books to the cart, proceeding to checkout, and exporting a digital receipt upon successful purchase. This project focuses on delivering an efficient, user-friendly, and reliable bookstore experience through a clean interface and well-structured database design.
